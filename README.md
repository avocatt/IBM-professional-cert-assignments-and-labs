# IBM Professional Data Science Certificate Assignments and Labs

### Assignments 
[Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard](https://github.com/avocatt/IBM-professional-cert-assignments-and-labs/blob/main/Final-Assignment.ipynb) 

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some essential economic indicators from some data, you will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. You can then share the dashboard via an URL.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, you will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. You will take screen shots of every step, you will share the notebook and the URL pointing to the dashboard.

[Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/avocatt/IBM-professional-cert-assignments-and-labs/blob/main/data_analysis_with_python_assignment.ipynb) 

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

[Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/avocatt/IBM-professional-cert-assignments-and-labs/blob/main/data_analysis_with_python_assignment.ipynb) 
A survey was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely:

1. Big Data (Spark / Hadoop) 
2. Data Analysis / Statistics 
3. Data Journalism Data Visualization 
4. Data Visualization 
5. Deep Learning 
6. Machine Learning 

The participants had three options for each topic: Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested. 2,233 respondents completed the survey.
